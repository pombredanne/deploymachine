Preface
=======

DeployMachine is:

* Bootstrapping tool for provisioning servers.
* Tiny wrapper around configuration management tools such as chef,
  kokki, and puppet.
* Deployment framework for launching and maintaining websites.
* Slew of fabric commands for common tasks.

This documentation notes any features which have yet to be
implemented. A work in progress. C'est la vie.

.. warning::

   The included kokki cookbooks and recipies are working, but not
   entirely complete. Chef and Puppet support is forthcoming.
