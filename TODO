ALPHA TASKS
===========

Save download time and bandwith by cloning a default provision.
    1. check if the image exists.
    2. if it does not exist, create it.
    3. if it does exist (and force_provision != True) use it and skip the provision step.

DNSimple support for killing/booting the main loadbalancer and updating the DNS.

Test all apptypes and combinations.
